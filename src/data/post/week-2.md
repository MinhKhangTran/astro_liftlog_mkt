This Website is my redesign of a freelancer template website from Brad Traversy

<br/>

Learnings of this Challenge:

  <br/>

  <ul>
  
  <li>
  A full-width Hero image is harder to use than expected
  </li>

  <li>
  Take some breaks after failing too long is helpful
  </li>

  <li>
  I miss the image plugin from Gatsby ðŸ¥º
  </li>

  </ul>
